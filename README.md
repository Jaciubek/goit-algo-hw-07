Homework description

Task 1

Write an algorithm (function) that finds the largest value in a binary search tree or AVL tree. Take any tree implementation from the textbook or another source.


Task 2

Write an algorithm (function) that finds the smallest value in a binary search tree or AVL tree. Take any tree implementation from the textbook or another source.


Task 3

Write an algorithm (function) that finds the sum of all values in a binary search tree or AVL tree. Take any tree implementation from the notes or another source.

***

Binary Search Tree (BST): A binary tree in which, for each node, all values ​​in the left subtree are smaller and all values ​​in the right subtree are larger.
AVL Tree: A self-balancing binary search tree in which the height difference between the left and right subtrees cannot be greater than one for all nodes.
